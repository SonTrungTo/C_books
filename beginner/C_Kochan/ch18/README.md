### Some notes about the sequence of programs.

* p18-2.c: The placement of the debugger (DEBUG) is clumsy, so one way to change
this is to change the way preprocessor is used.
* p18-3.c: Preprocessor is changed so that the codes look neater;
a further improvement would be to include the level of the debugger
so that appropriate outputs are produced.
* p18-3-2.c: Codes do not work as expected; levels are being ignored!
