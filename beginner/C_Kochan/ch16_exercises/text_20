Plastic Love - Mariya Takeuchi
Original and translated lyrics:

Totsuzen no kisu ya atsui manazashi de
[With a sudden kiss or a fiery stare]

Koi no puroguramu o kuruwasenai de ne
[Don't mess up my programs of love]

Deai to wakare jōzu ni uchikonde
[I've input hellos and goodbyes so neatly]

Jikan ga kureba owaru
[Everything comes to an end in due time]

Don't hurry!

Ai ni kizutsuita anohi kara zutto
[Ever since that day I got hurt by love]

Hiru to yoru ga gyaku no kurashi o tsuzukete
[I've been living a vampire life]

Hayari no disco de odori akasu uchini
[While dancing nights away at trendy discos]

Oboeta majutsu nanoyo
[I've learned this magic]

I'm sorry!

Watashi no koto o keshite honki de aisanai de
[Never love me seriously]

Koi nante tadano gēmu
[Love is just a game]

Tanoshimeba sorede iino
[If I'm having fun, that's enough]

Tozashita kokoro o kazaru hadena doresu mo kutsu mo
[Fancy dresses and shoes that decorate my closed mind]

Kodoku na tomodachi
[They're my friends to ease loneliness]

(Guitar solo)

Watashi o sasou hito wa hinikuna mono ne itsumo kare ni niteruwa nazeka
[Ironically every guy who asks me out looks like him for some reason]

Omoide to kasanariau
[That provokes my memories]

Gurasu o otoshite kyū ni namidagundemo
[Even if I drop a glass and suddenly fill my eyes with tears]

Wake wa tazunenai de ne
[Don't ask me why]

Ai ni kizutsuita anohi kara zutto
[Ever since that day I got hurt by love]

Hiru to yoru ga gyaku no kurashi o tsuzukete
[I've been living a vampire life]

Hayari no disco de odori akasu uchini
[While dancing nights away at trendy discos]

Oboeta majutsu nanoyo
[I've learned this magic]

I'm sorry!

Watashi no koto o keshite honki de aisanai de
[Never love me seriously]

Koi nante tadano gēmu
[Love is just a game]

Tanoshimeba sorede iino
[If I'm having fun, that's enough]

Tozashita kokoro o kazaru hadena doresu mo kutsu mo
[Fancy dresses and shoes that decorate my closed mind]

Kodoku na tomodachi
[They're my friends to ease loneliness]

Yohuke no kōsoku de nemuri ni tsuku koro
[When I fall asleep on an expressway late at night]

Harogen raito dake ayashiku kagayaku
[Only halogen lights shine mysteriously]

Kōri no yōni tsumetai onna dato
[That I'm a woman as cold as ice]

Sasayaku koe ga shitemo
[Even if you hear a voice whispering so]

Don't worry!

I'm just playing games

I know that's plastic love

Dance to the plastic beat

Another morning comes
