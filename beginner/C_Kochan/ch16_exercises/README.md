### Summary of Exercises content in chapter 16.

* copyFileUpper.c == Exercise 3: Program to copy one file to another,
replacing all lowercase characters with their uppercase equivalents.
* mergeAlter.c == Exercise 4: Program to merge lines alternately; if one file
has less lines than the other, the remaining lines from the larger files
are simply copied to stdout.
* columns_m_n.c == Exercise 5: Program to write columns m through n of each
line of a file to stdout. **NOTE:** a very weird error using fgets with character
strings.
* 20_lines.c == Exercise 6: Program to display 20 lines successively from a file
with the touch a button other than 'q' and to end the program if 'q' is touched.
**LESSON:** scanf reading reads the last one that is terminated.
