SON'S JOURNAL

TODAY IS DECEMBER 19TH, 2017. IT HAS BEEN EXACTLY 1 YEAR SINCE I
START WORKING AT KILTAKELLARI, SODEXO OY. TRUTHFULLY, THE JOB IS TOUGH
AS HELL: I HAVE TO WORK MY ASS OFF WHILE TRYING TO KEEP FOCUS ON MY
STUDIES AND TO BE A "NORMAL" DISHWASHER BOY, TO WHICH I TRIED BY
DIGRESSING TO TOPICS SUCH AS WOMEN AND TRYING TO BE NICE TO THEM;
HOWEVER, SOME OF WHOM MISTOOK THAT I SEXUALLY HARASS THEM, WHICH
MAKES ME TOTALLY FEEL DISGUSTING CONSIDERING THAT THEY ARE TOTALLY INFERIOR
TO ME IN TERM OF ACADEMIC ABILITY. I HATE THIS, BUT I MUST NOT BE CAREFUL
NOT TO RAISE ANY SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR THAT MAKES MY COWORKERS THINK THAT
I AM SOME KIND OF GENIUS AND SOMEONE WHO IS BETTER THAN THEM!
I RESPECT PEOPLE, BUT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE.

THE ONLY WOMAN WHOM I HAVE EVER TRULY CARED FOR IS INGRID HÃ¶LM, FINLAND
LUCIA 2016. TODAY I WILL GO TO HER CONCERT AND CONFESS TO HER; I EXPECT
99% FAILURE, THOUGH. EVEN SO, I WANT TO CARVE INTO MY MEMOIR THE FACT
THAT SHE IS THE ONLY WOMAN I WILL EVER THINK OF. THANKS TO HER,
I REALIZE THAT EVEN IF IT MEANS TO HAVE UNREQUITED LOVE FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE, I AM HAPPY WITH THAT. LOVING ANY OTHER WOMAN THAN INGRID
SEEMS TO SURPASS MY CAPABILITY!

AFTER MY REJECTION WITH UTMOST CERTAINTY, I WILL ONLY STUDY. I HAVE TO;
IT IS MY DREAM TO CULTIVATE MYSELF! HOPEFULLY, I WILL GET MY FINNISH
CITIZENSHIP SOON SO THAT I CAN COMPLETELY CONCENTRATE ON MY STUDIES
AT A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN FIND ME. YAY!

MY ONLY LAST WISH, IF I COULD, IS TO SEE INGRID SAFE, HAPPY AND
EVER-PASSIONATE IN HER SINGING (OR WHATEVER SHE DOES)!
