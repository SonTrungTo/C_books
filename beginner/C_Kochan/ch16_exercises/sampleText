Son's journal

Today is December 19th, 2017. It has been exactly 1 year since I
start working at Kiltakellari, Sodexo Oy. Truthfully, the job is tough
as hell: I have to work my ass off while trying to keep focus on my
studies and to be a "normal" dishwasher boy, to which I tried by
digressing to topics such as women and trying to be nice to them;
however, some of whom mistook that I sexually harass them, which
makes me totally feel disgusting considering that they are totally inferior
to me in term of academic ability. I hate this, but I must not be careful
not to raise any suspicious behavior that makes my coworkers think that
I am some kind of genius and someone who is better than them!
I respect people, but there are all kinds of people out there.

The only woman whom I have ever truly cared for is Ingrid HÃ¶lm, Finland
Lucia 2016. Today I will go to her concert and confess to her; I expect
99% failure, though. Even so, I want to carve into my memoir the fact
that she is the only woman I will ever think of. Thanks to her,
I realize that even if it means to have unrequited love for the rest
of my life, I am happy with that. Loving any other woman than Ingrid
seems to surpass my capability!

After my rejection with utmost certainty, I will only study. I have to;
it is my dream to cultivate myself! Hopefully, I will get my Finnish
citizenship soon so that I can completely concentrate on my studies
at a place where nobody can find me. YAY!

My only last wish, if I could, is to see Ingrid safe, happy and
ever-passionate in her singing (or whatever she does)!
