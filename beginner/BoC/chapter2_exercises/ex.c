/*
*   Exercise 1: Is main a keyword? Explain. NO! Keywords cannot be modified in anyway,
* while main() is an identifier for a function.
*   Exercise 2: int, float, const, char, double, return.
*   Exercise 3:
*   - Keywords:         int, struct
*   - Identifiers:      main, <function name>, <variable name>
*   - Constant:         3, -3.5, 'c', "c"
    - String Constant:  "Dies Irae", " ", ""
    - Operator:         main() ,+. -, *, +=
    - Punctuator:       (1 + 2), int a, b, c;
    Exercise 4: Using definition of identifier,
    3id       1_i_am      one_i_aren't      me_to-2     00_go     star*it
    Exercise 5:  Too easy.
    Exercise 6: ++a, a++, a += 1, a + 1.
    Exercise 7, 8: Too easy.
    Exercise 11: i++ turns the program into "Computing 2^{n + 1}".
    Exercise 12: A simple variation that prints all 2^n backwards.
    Exercise 14: 2 1 1,
                 2 2 2,
                 5 3 3,
                 5 2 2
    Exercise 15:  x = (y = 2) + z = 3 ==> x = (2 + z = 3) ==> x = z = 1 and y = 2
                * x = y = 2 + (z = 3) ==> x = y = 5 and z = 3
                  x = y = 2 + z = 3 ==> x = y = ((2 + z) = 3) ==> x = y = z = 1
    HOWEVER, with the exception of *, the rest will be compile-time error since
    left-hand side needs lvalue (needs to be assigned to a const.)
    Exercise 16: Results: 4, 7, -7, 7. Error == run-time error.
