lARA  HAD  BEEN  BACK  AND  FORTH  ALONG  THE  RIVER  PATH  MANY  TIMES  IN  HER  SHORT  LIFE  hER  PEOPLE  HAD  NOT  CREATED  THE  PATHIT  HAD  ALWAYS  BEEN  THERE  LIKE  THE  RIVERBUT  THEIR  DEERSKINSHOD  FEET  AND  THE  WOODEN  WHEELS  OF  THEIR  HANDCARTS  KEPT  THE  PATH  WELL  WORN  lARAS  PEOPLE  WERE  SALT  TRADERS  AND  THEIR  LIVELIHOOD  TOOK  THEM  ON  A  CONTINUAL  JOURNEY

aT  THE  MOUTH  OF  THE  RIVER  THE  LITTLE  GROUP  OF  HALF  A  DOZEN  INTERMINGLED  FAMILIES  GATHERED  SALT  FROM  THE  GREAT  SALT  BEDS  BESIDE  THE  SEA  tHEY  GROOMED  AND  SIFTED  THE  SALT  AND  LOADED  IT  INTO  HANDCARTS  wHEN  THE  CARTS  WERE  FULL  MOST  OF  THE  GROUP  WOULD  STAY  BEHIND  TAKING  SHELTER  AMID  ROCKS  AND  SIMPLE  LEANTOS  WHILE  A  BAND  OF  FIFTEEN  OR  SO  OF  THE  HEARTIER  MEMBERS  SET  OUT  ON  THE  PATH  THAT  RAN  ALONGSIDE  THE  RIVER

wITH  THEIR  PRECIOUS  CARGO  OF  SALT  THE  TRAVELERS  CROSSED  THE  COASTAL  LOWLANDS  AND  TRAVELED  TOWARD  THE  MOUNTAINS  bUT  lARAS  PEOPLE  NEVER  REACHED  THE  MOUNTAINTOPS  THEY  TRAVELED  ONLY  AS  FAR  AS  THE  FOOTHILLS  mANY  PEOPLE  LIVED  IN  THE  FORESTS  AND  GRASSY  MEADOWS  OF  THE  FOOTHILLS  GATHERED  IN  SMALL  VILLAGES  iN  RETURN  FOR  SALT  THESE  PEOPLE  WOULD  GIVE  lARAS  PEOPLE  DRIED  MEAT  ANIMAL  SKINS  CLOTH  SPUN  FROM  WOOL  CLAY  POTS  NEEDLES  AND  SCRAPING  TOOLS  CARVED  FROM  BONE  AND  LITTLE  TOYS  MADE  OF  WOOD

tHEIR  BARTERING  DONE  lARA  AND  HER  PEOPLE  WOULD  TRAVEL  BACK  DOWN  THE  RIVER  PATH  TO  THE  SEA  tHE  CYCLE  WOULD  BEGIN  AGAIN

iT  HAD  ALWAYS  BEEN  LIKE  THIS  lARA  KNEW  NO  OTHER  LIFE  sHE  TRAVELED  BACK  AND  FORTH  UP  AND  DOWN  THE  RIVER  PATH  nO  SINGLE  PLACE  WAS  HOME  sHE  LIKED  THE  SEASIDE  WHERE  THERE  WAS  ALWAYS  FISH  TO  EAT  AND  THE  GENTLE  LAPPING  OF  THE  WAVES  LULLED  HER  TO  SLEEP  AT  NIGHT  sHE  WAS  LESS  FOND  OF  THE  FOOTHILLS  WHERE  THE  PATH  GREW  STEEP  THE  NIGHTS  COULD  BE  COLD  AND  VIEWS  OF  GREAT  DISTANCES  MADE  HER  DIZZY  sHE  FELT  UNEASY  IN  THE  VILLAGES  AND  WAS  OFTEN  SHY  AROUND  STRANGERS  tHE  PATH  ITSELF  WAS  WHERE  SHE  FELT  MOST  AT  HOME  sHE  LOVED  THE  SMELL  OF  THE  RIVER  ON  A  HOT  DAY  AND  THE  CROAKING  OF  FROGS  AT  NIGHT  vINES  GREW  AMID  THE  LUSH  FOLIAGE  ALONG  THE  RIVER  WITH  BERRIES  THAT  WERE  GOOD  TO  EAT  eVEN  ON  THE  HOTTEST  DAY  SUNDOWN  BROUGHT  A  COOL  BREEZE  OFF  THE  WATER  WHICH  SIGHED  AND  SANG  AMID  THE  REEDS  AND  TALL  GRASSES

oF  ALL  THE  PLACES  ALONG  THE  PATH  THE  AREA  THEY  WERE  APPROACHING  WITH  THE  ISLAND  IN  THE  RIVER  WAS  lARAS  FAVORITE

tHE  TERRAIN  ALONG  THIS  STRETCH  OF  THE  RIVER  WAS  MOSTLY  FLAT  BUT  IN  THE  IMMEDIATE  VICINITY  OF  THE  ISLAND  THE  LAND  ON  THE  SUNRISE  SIDE  WAS  LIKE  A  RUMPLED  CLOTH  WITH  HILLS  AND  RIDGES  AND  VALLEYS  aMONG  lARAS  PEOPLE  THERE  WAS  A  WOODEN  BABYS  CRIB  SUITABLE  FOR  STRAPPING  TO  A  CART  THAT  HAD  BEEN  PASSED  DOWN  FOR  GENERATIONS  tHE  ISLAND  WAS  SHAPED  LIKE  THAT  CRIB  LONGER  THAN  IT  WAS  WIDE  AND  POINTED  AT  THE  UPRIVER  END  WHERE  THE  FLOW  HAD  ERODED  BOTH  BANKS  tHE  ISLAND  WAS  LIKE  A  CRIB  AND  THE  GROUP  OF  HILLS  ON  THE  SUNRISE  SIDE  OF  THE  RIVER  WERE  LIKE  OLD  WOMEN  MANTLED  IN  HEAVY  CLOAKS  GATHERED  TO  HAVE  A  LOOK  AT  THE  BABY  IN  THE  CRIBTHAT  WAS  HOW  lARAS  FATHER  HAD  ONCE  DESCRIBED  THE  LAY  OF  THE  LAND

lARTH  SPOKE  LIKE  THAT  ALL  THE  TIME  CONJURING  IMAGES  OF  GIANTS  AND  MONSTERS  IN  THE  LANDSCAPE  hE  COULD  PERCEIVE  THE  SPIRITS  CALLED  NUMINA  THAT  DWELLED  IN  ROCKS  AND  TREES  sOMETIMES  HE  COULD  SPEAK  TO  THEM  AND  HEAR  WHAT  THEY  HAD  TO  SAY  tHE  RIVER  WAS  HIS  OLDEST  FRIEND  AND  TOLD  HIM  WHERE  THE  FISHING  WOULD  BE  BEST  fROM  WHISPERS  IN  THE  WIND  HE  COULD  FORETELL  THE  NEXT  DAYS  WEATHER  bECAUSE  OF  SUCH  SKILLS  lARTH  WAS  THE  LEADER  OF  THE  GROUP

wERE  CLOSE  TO  THE  ISLAND  ARENT  WE  pAPA  SAID  lARA

hOW  DID  YOU  KNOW

tHE  HILLS  fIRST  WE  START  TO  SEE  THE  HILLS  OFF  TO  THE  RIGHT  tHE  HILLS  GROW  BIGGER  aND  JUST  BEFORE  WE  COME  TO  THE  ISLAND  WE  CAN  SEE  THE  SILHOUETTE  OF  THAT  FIG  TREE  UP  THERE  ALONG  THE  CREST  OF  THAT  HILL

gOOD  GIRL  SAID  lARTH  PROUD  OF  HIS  DAUGHTERS  MEMORY  AND  POWERS  OF  OBSERVATION  hE  WAS  A  STRONG  HANDSOME  MAN  WITH  FLECKS  OF  GRAY  IN  HIS  BLACK  BEARD  hIS  WIFE  HAD  BORNE  SEVERAL  CHILDREN  BUT  ALL  HAD  DIED  VERY  YOUNG  EXCEPT  lARA  THE  LAST  WHOM  HIS  WIFE  HAD  DIED  BEARING  lARA  WAS  VERY  PRECIOUS  TO  HIM  lIKE  HER  MOTHER  SHE  HAD  GOLDEN  HAIR  nOW  THAT  SHE  HAD  REACHED  THE  AGE  OF  CHILDBEARING  lARA  WAS  BEGINNING  TO  DISPLAY  THE  FULLNESS  OF  A  WOMANS  HIPS  AND  BREASTS  iT  WAS  lARTHS  GREATEST  WISH  THAT  HE  MIGHT  LIVE  TO  SEE  HIS  OWN  GRANDCHILDREN  nOT  EVERY  MAN  LIVED  THAT  LONG  BUT  lARTH  WAS  HOPEFUL  hE  HAD  BEEN  HEALTHY  ALL  HIS  LIFE  PARTLY  HE  BELIEVED  BECAUSE  HE  HAD  ALWAYS  BEEN  CAREFUL  TO  SHOW  RESPECT  TO  THE  NUMINA  HE  ENCOUNTERED  ON  HIS  JOURNEYS

rESPECTING  THE  NUMINA  WAS  IMPORTANT  tHE  NUMEN  OF  THE  RIVER  COULD  SUCK  A  MAN  UNDER  AND  DROWN  HIM  tHE  NUMEN  OF  A  TREE  COULD  TRIP  A  MAN  WITH  ITS  ROOTS  OR  DROP  A  ROTTEN  BRANCH  ON  HIS  HEAD  rOCKS  COULD  GIVE  WAY  UNDERFOOT  CHUCKLING  WITH  AMUSEMENT  AT  THEIR  OWN  TREACHERY  eVEN  THE  SKY  WITH  A  ROAR  OF  FURY  SOMETIMES  SENT  DOWN  FINGERS  OF  FIRE  THAT  COULD  ROAST  A  MAN  LIKE  A  RABBIT  ON  A  SPIT  OR  WORSE  LEAVE  HIM  ALIVE  BUT  ROBBED  OF  HIS  SENSES  lARTH  HAD  HEARD  THAT  THE  EARTH  ITSELF  COULD  OPEN  AND  SWALLOW  A  MAN  THOUGH  HE  HAD  NEVER  ACTUALLY  SEEN  SUCH  A  THING  HE  NEVERTHELESS  PERFORMED  A  RITUAL  EACH  MORNING  ASKING  THE  EARTHS  PERMISSION  BEFORE  HE  WENT  STRIDING  ACROSS  IT

tHERES  SOMETHING  SO  SPECIAL  ABOUT  THIS  PLACE  SAID  lARA  GAZING  AT  THE  SPARKLING  RIVER  TO  HER  LEFT  AND  THEN  AT  THE  ROCKY  TREESPOTTED  HILLS  AHEAD  AND  TO  HER  RIGHT  hOW  WAS  IT  MADE  wHO  MADE  IT

lARTH  FROWNED  tHE  QUESTION  MADE  NO  SENSE  TO  HIM  a  PLACE  WAS  NEVER  MADE  IT  SIMPLY  WAS  sMALL  FEATURES  MIGHT  CHANGE  OVER  TIME  uPROOTED  BY  A  STORM  A  TREE  MIGHT  FALL  INTO  THE  RIVER  a  BOULDER  MIGHT  DECIDE  TO  TUMBLE  DOWN  THE  HILLSIDE  tHE  NUMINA  THAT  ANIMATED  ALL  THINGS  WENT  ABOUT  RESHAPING  THE  LANDSCAPE  FROM  DAY  TO  DAY  BUT  THE  ESSENTIAL  THINGS  NEVER  CHANGED  AND  HAD  ALWAYS  EXISTED  THE  RIVER  THE  HILLS  THE  SKY  THE  SUN  THE  SEA  THE  SALT  BEDS  AT  THE  MOUTH  OF  THE  RIVER

hE  WAS  TRYING  TO  THINK  OF  SOME  WAY  TO  EXPRESS  THESE  THOUGHTS  TO  lARA  WHEN  A  DEER  DRINKING  AT  THE  RIVER  WAS  STARTLED  BY  THEIR  APPROACH  tHE  DEER  BOLTED  UP  THE  BRUSHY  BANK  AND  ONTO  THE  PATH  iNSTEAD  OF  RUNNING  TO  SAFETY  THE  CREATURE  STOOD  AND  STARED  AT  THEM  aS  CLEARLY  AS  IF  THE  ANIMAL  HAD  WHISPERED  ALOUD  lARTH  HEARD  THE  WORDS  eAT  ME  tHE  DEER  WAS  OFFERING  HERSELF

lARTH  TURNED  TO  SHOUT  AN  ORDER  BUT  THE  MOST  SKILLED  HUNTER  OF  THE  GROUP  A  YOUTH  CALLED  pO  WAS  ALREADY  IN  MOTION  pO  RAN  FORWARD  RAISED  THE  SHARPENED  STICK  HE  ALWAYS  CARRIED  AND  HURLED  IT  WHISTLING  THROUGH  THE  AIR  BETWEEN  lARTH  AND  lARA

a  HEARTBEAT  LATER  THE  SPEAR  STRUCK  THE  DEERS  BREAST  WITH  SUCH  FORCE  THAT  THE  CREATURE  WAS  KNOCKED  TO  THE  GROUND  uNABLE  TO  RISE  SHE  THRASHED  HER  NECK  AND  FLAILED  HER  LONG  SLENDER  LEGS  pO  RAN  PAST  lARTH  AND  lARA  wHEN  HE  REACHED  THE  DEER  HE  PULLED  THE  SPEAR  FREE  AND  STABBED  THE  CREATURE  AGAIN  tHE  DEER  RELEASED  A  STIFLED  NOISE  LIKE  A  GASP  AND  STOPPED  MOVING

tHERE  WAS  A  CHEER  FROM  THE  GROUP  iNSTEAD  OF  YET  ANOTHER  DINNER  OF  FISH  FROM  THE  RIVER  TONIGHT  THERE  WOULD  BE  VENISON

tHE  DISTANCE  FROM  THE  RIVERBANK  TO  THE  ISLAND  WAS  NOT  GREAT  BUT  AT  THIS  TIME  OF  YEAREARLY  SUMMERTHE  RIVER  WAS  TOO  HIGH  TO  WADE  ACROSS  lARAS  PEOPLE  HAD  LONG  AGO  MADE  SIMPLE  RAFTS  OF  BRANCHES  LASHED  TOGETHER  WITH  LEATHER  THONGS  WHICH  THEY  LEFT  ON  THE  RIVERBANKS  REPAIRING  AND  REPLACING  THEM  AS  NEEDED  wHEN  THEY  LAST  PASSED  THIS  WAY  THERE  HAD  BEEN  THREE  RAFTS  ALL  IN  GOOD  CONDITION  LEFT  ON  THE  EAST  BANK  tWO  OF  THE  RAFTS  WERE  STILL  THERE  BUT  ONE  WAS  MISSING

i  SEE  IT  tHEREPULLED  UP  ON  THE  BANK  OF  THE  ISLAND  ALMOST  HIDDEN  AMONG  THOSE  LEAVES  SAID  pO  WHOSE  EYES  WERE  SHARP  sOMEONE  MUST  HAVE  USED  IT  TO  CROSS  OVER

pERHAPS  THEYRE  STILL  ON  THE  ISLAND  SAID  lARTH  hE  DID  NOT  BEGRUDGE  OTHERS  THE  USE  OF  THE  RAFTS  AND  THE  ISLAND  WAS  LARGE  ENOUGH  TO  SHARE  nONETHELESS  THE  SITUATION  REQUIRED  CAUTION  hE  CUPPED  HIS  HANDS  TO  HIS  MOUTH  AND  GAVE  A  SHOUT  iT  WAS  NOT  LONG  BEFORE  A  MAN  APPEARED  ON  THE  BANK  OF  THE  ISLAND  tHE  MAN  WAVED

dO  WE  KNOW  HIM  SAID  lARTH  SQUINTING

i  DONT  THINK  SO  SAID  pO  hES  YOUNGMY  AGE  OR  YOUNGER  iD  SAY  hE  LOOKS  STRONG

vERY  STRONG  SAID  lARA  eVEN  FROM  THIS  DISTANCE  THE  YOUNG  STRANGERS  BRAWNINESS  WAS  IMPRESSIVE  hE  WORE  A  SHORT  TUNIC  WITHOUT  SLEEVES  AND  lARA  HAD  NEVER  SEEN  SUCH  ARMS  ON  A  MAN

pO  WHO  WAS  SMALL  AND  WIRY  LOOKED  AT  lARA  SIDELONG  AND  FROWNED  iM  NOT  SURE  i  LIKE  THE  LOOK  OF  THIS  STRANGER

wHY  NOT  SAID  lARA  hES  SMILING  AT  US

iN  FACT  THE  YOUNG  MAN  WAS  SMILING  AT  lARA  AND  lARA  ALONE

hIS  NAME  WAS  tARKETIOS  mUCH  MORE  THAN  THAT  lARTH  COULD  NOT  TELL  FOR  THE  STRANGER  SPOKE  A  LANGUAGE  WHICH  lARTH  DID  NOT  RECOGNIZE  IN  WHICH  EACH  WORD  SEEMED  AS  LONG  AND  CONVOLUTED  AS  THE  MANS  NAME  uNDERSTANDING  THE  DEER  HAD  BEEN  EASIER  THAN  UNDERSTANDING  THE  STRANGE  NOISES  UTTERED  BY  THIS  MAN  AND  HIS  TWO  COMPANIONS  eVEN  SO  THEY  SEEMED  FRIENDLY  AND  THE  THREE  OF  THEM  PRESENTED  NO  THREAT  TO  THE  MORE  NUMEROUS  SALT  TRADERS

tARKETIOS  AND  HIS  TWO  OLDER  COMPANIONS  WERE  SKILLED  METALWORKERS  FROM  A  REGION  SOME  TWO  HUNDRED  MILES  TO  THE  NORTH  WHERE  THE  HILLS  WERE  RICH  WITH  IRON  COPPER  AND  LEAD  tHEY  HAD  BEEN  ON  A  TRADING  JOURNEY  TO  THE  SOUTH  AND  WERE  RETURNING  HOME  jUST  AS  THE  RIVER  PATH  CARRIED  lARTHS  PEOPLE  FROM  THE  SEASHORE  TO  THE  HILLS  SO  ANOTHER  PATH  PERPENDICULAR  TO  THE  RIVER  TRAVERSED  THE  LONG  COASTAL  PLAIN  bECAUSE  THE  ISLAND  PROVIDED  AN  EASY  PLACE  TO  FORD  THE  RIVER  IT  WAS  HERE  THAT  THE  TWO  PATHS  INTERSECTED  oN  THIS  OCCASION  THE  SALT  TRADERS  AND  THE  METAL  TRADERS  HAPPENED  TO  ARRIVE  AT  THE  ISLAND  ON  THE  SAME  DAY  nOW  THEY  MET  FOR  THE  FIRST  TIME

tHE  TWO  GROUPS  MADE  SEPARATE  CAMPS  AT  OPPOSITE  ENDS  OF  THE  ISLAND  aS  A  GESTURE  OF  FRIENDSHIP  SPEAKING  WITH  HIS  HANDS  lARTH  INVITED  tARKETIOS  AND  THE  OTHERS  TO  SHARE  THE  VENISON  THAT  NIGHT  aS  THE  HOSTS  AND  THEIR  GUESTS  FEASTED  AROUND  THE  ROASTING  FIRE  tARKETIOS  TRIED  TO  EXPLAIN  SOMETHING  OF  HIS  CRAFT  fIRELIGHT  GLITTERED  IN  lARAS  EYES  AS  SHE  WATCHED  tARKETIOS  POINT  AT  THE  FLAMES  AND  MIME  THE  ACT  OF  HAMMERING  fIRELIGHT  DANCED  ACROSS  THE  FLEXING  MUSCLES  OF  HIS  ARMS  AND  SHOULDERS  wHEN  HE  SMILED  AT  HER  HIS  GRIN  WAS  LIKE  A  BOAST  sHE  HAD  NEVER  SEEN  TEETH  SO  WHITE  AND  SO  PERFECT

pO  SAW  THE  LOOKS  THE  TWO  EXCHANGED  AND  FROWNED  lARAS  FATHER  SAW  THE  SAME  LOOKS  AND  SMILED

tHE  MEAL  WAS  OVER  tHE  METAL  TRADERS  AFTER  MANY  GESTURES  OF  GRATITUDE  FOR  THE  VENISON  WITHDREW  TO  THEIR  CAMP  AT  THE  FAR  SIDE  OF  THE  ISLAND  bEFORE  HE  DISAPPEARED  INTO  THE  SHADOWS  tARKETIOS  LOOKED  OVER  HIS  SHOULDER  AND  GAVE  lARA  A  PARTING  GRIN

wHILE  THE  OTHERS  SETTLED  DOWN  TO  SLEEP  lARTH  STAYED  AWAKE  A  WHILE  LONGER  AS  WAS  HIS  HABIT  hE  LIKED  TO  WATCH  THE  FIRE  lIKE  ALL  OTHER  THINGS  FIRE  POSSESSED  A  NUMEN  THAT  SOMETIMES  COMMUNICATED  WITH  HIM  SHOWING  HIM  VISIONS  aS  THE  LAST  OF  THE  EMBERS  FADED  INTO  DARKNESS  lARTH  FELL  ASLEEP

lARTH  BLINKED  tHE  FLAMES  WHICH  HAD  DWINDLED  TO  ALMOST  NOTHING  SUDDENLY  SHOT  UP  AGAIN  hOT  AIR  RUSHED  OVER  HIS  FACE  hIS  EYES  WERE  SEARED  BY  WHITE  FLAMES  BRIGHTER  THAN  THE  SUN

aMID  THE  DAZZLING  BRIGHTNESS  HE  PERCEIVED  A  THING  THAT  LEVITATED  ABOVE  THE  FLAMES  iT  WAS  A  MASCULINE  MEMBER  DISEMBODIED  BUT  NONETHELESS  RAMPANT  AND  UPRIGHT  iT  BORE  WINGS  LIKE  A  BIRD  AND  HOVERED  IN  MIDAIR  tHOUGH  IT  SEEMED  TO  BE  MADE  OF  FLESH  IT  WAS  IMPERVIOUS  TO  THE  FLAMES

lARTH  HAD  SEEN  THE  WINGED  PHALLUS  BEFORE  ALWAYS  IN  SUCH  CIRCUMSTANCES  WHEN  HE  STARED  AT  A  FIRE  AND  ENTERED  A  DREAM  STATE  hE  HAD  EVEN  GIVEN  IT  A  NAME  OR  MORE  PRECISELY  THE  THING  HAD  PLANTED  ITS  NAME  IN  HIS  MIND  fASCINUS

fASCINUS  WAS  NOT  LIKE  THE  NUMINA  THAT  ANIMATED  TREES  STONES  OR  RIVERS  tHOSE  NUMINA  EXISTED  WITHOUT  NAMES  eACH  WAS  BOUND  TO  THE  OBJECT  IN  WHICH  IT  RESIDED  AND  THERE  WAS  LITTLE  TO  DIFFERENTIATE  ONE  FROM  ANOTHER  wHEN  SUCH  NUMINA  SPOKE  THEY  COULD  NOT  ALWAYS  BE  TRUSTED  sOMETIMES  THEY  WERE  FRIENDLY  BUT  AT  OTHER  TIMES  THEY  WERE  MISCHIEVOUS  OR  EVEN  HOSTILE

fASCINUS  WAS  DIFFERENT  iT  WAS  UNIQUE  iT  EXISTED  IN  AND  OF  ITSELF  WITHOUT  BEGINNING  OR  END  cLEARLY  FROM  ITS  FORM  IT  HAD  SOMETHING  TO  DO  WITH  LIFE  AND  THE  ORIGIN  OF  LIFE  YET  IT  SEEMED  TO  COME  FROM  A  PLACE  BEYOND  THIS  WORLD  SLIPPING  FOR  A  FEW  MOMENTS  THROUGH  A  BREACH  OPENED  BY  THE  HEAT  OF  THE  DANCING  FLAMES  aN  APPEARANCE  BY  fASCINUS  WAS  ALWAYS  SIGNIFICANT  tHE  WINGED  PHALLUS  NEVER  APPEARED  WITHOUT  GIVING  lARTH  AN  ANSWER  TO  A  DILEMMA  THAT  HAD  BEEN  TROUBLING  HIM  OR  PLANTING  AN  IMPORTANT  NEW  THOUGHT  IN  HIS  MIND  tHE  GUIDANCE  GIVEN  TO  HIM  BY  fASCINUS  HAD  NEVER  LED  lARTH  ASTRAY

eLSEWHERE  IN  DISTANT  LANDSgREECE  iSRAEL  eGYPTMEN  AND  WOMEN  WORSHIPED  GODS  AND  GODDESSES  tHOSE  PEOPLE  MADE  IMAGES  OF  THEIR  GODS  TOLD  STORIES  ABOUT  THEM  AND  WORSHIPED  THEM  IN  TEMPLES  lARTH  HAD  NEVER  MET  SUCH  PEOPLE  hE  HAD  NEVER  EVEN  HEARD  OF  THE  LANDS  WHERE  THEY  LIVED  AND  HE  HAD  NEVER  ENCOUNTERED  OR  CONCEIVED  OF  A  GOD  tHE  VERY  CONCEPT  OF  A  DEITY  SUCH  AS  THOSE  OTHER  MEN  WORSHIPED  WAS  UNKNOWN  TO  lARTH  BUT  THE  CLOSEST  THING  TO  A  GOD  IN  HIS  IMAGINATION  AND  EXPERIENCE  WAS  fASCINUS

wITH  A  START  HE  BLINKED  AGAIN

tHE  FLAMES  HAD  DIED  iN  PLACE  OF  INTOLERABLE  BRIGHTNESS  THERE  WAS  ONLY  THE  DARKNESS  OF  A  WARM  SUMMER  NIGHT  LIT  BY  THE  FAINTEST  SLIVER  OF  A  MOON  tHE  AIR  ON  HIS  FACE  WAS  NO  LONGER  HOT  BUT  FRESH  AND  COOL

fASCINUS  HAD  VANISHEDBUT  NOT  WITHOUT  PLANTING  A  THOUGHT  IN  lARTHS  MIND  hE  HURRIED  TO  THE  LEAFY  BOWER  BESIDE  THE  RIVER  WHERE  lARA  LIKED  TO  SLEEP  THINKING  TO  HIMSELF  iT  MUST  BE  MADE  SO  BECAUSE  fASCINUS  SAYS  IT  MUST

hE  KNELT  BESIDE  HER  BUT  THERE  WAS  NO  NEED  TO  WAKE  HER  sHE  WAS  ALREADY  AWAKE

pAPA  wHAT  IS  IT

gO  TO  HIM

sHE  DID  NOT  NEED  TO  ASK  FOR  AN  EXPLANATION  iT  WAS  WHAT  SHE  HAD  BEEN  YEARNING  TO  DO  LYING  RESTLESS  AND  EAGER  IN  THE  DARK

aRE  YOU  SURE  pAPA

fASCINUS          hE  DID  NOT  FINISH  THE  THOUGHT  BUT  SHE  UNDERSTOOD  sHE  HAD  NEVER  SEEN  fASCINUS  BUT  HE  HAD  TOLD  HER  ABOUT  IT  mANY  TIMES  IN  THE  PAST  fASCINUS  HAD  GIVEN  GUIDANCE  TO  HER  FATHER  nOW  ONCE  AGAIN  fASCINUS  HAD  MADE  ITS  WILL  KNOWN

tHE  DARKNESS  DID  NOT  DETER  HER  sHE  KNEW  EVERY  TWIST  AND  TURN  OF  EVERY  PATH  ON  THE  LITTLE  ISLAND  wHEN  SHE  CAME  TO  THE  METAL  TRADERS  CAMP  SHE  FOUND  tARKETIOS  LYING  IN  A  LEAFY  NOOK  SECLUDED  FROM  THE  OTHERS  SHE  RECOGNIZED  HIM  BY  HIS  BRAWNY  SILHOUETTE  hE  WAS  AWAKE  AND  WAITING  JUST  AS  SHE  HAD  BEEN  LYING  AWAKE  WAITING  WHEN  HER  FATHER  CAME  TO  HER

aT  HER  APPROACH  tARKETIOS  ROSE  ONTO  HIS  ELBOWS  hE  SPOKE  HER  NAME  IN  A  WHISPER  tHERE  WAS  A  QUIVER  OF  SOMETHING  LIKE  DESPERATION  IN  HIS  VOICE  HIS  NEEDINESS  MADE  HER  SMILE  sHE  SIGHED  AND  LOWERED  HERSELF  BESIDE  HIM  bY  THE  FAINT  MOONLIGHT  SHE  SAW  THAT  HE  WORE  AN  AMULET  OF  SOME  SORT  SUSPENDED  FROM  A  STRAP  OF  LEATHER  AROUND  HIS  NECK  nESTLED  AMID  THE  HAIR  ON  HIS  CHEST  THE  BIT  OF  SHAPELESS  METAL  SEEMED  TO  CAPTURE  AND  CONCENTRATE  THE  FAINT  MOONLIGHT  CASTING  BACK  A  RADIANCE  BRIGHTER  THAN  THE  MOON  ITSELF

hIS  ARMSTHE  ARMS  SHE  HAD  SO  ADMIRED  EARLIERREACHED  OUT  AND  CLOSED  AROUND  HER  IN  A  SURPRISINGLY  GENTLE  EMBRACE  hIS  BODY  WAS  AS  WARM  AND  NAKED  AS  HER  OWN  BUT  MUCH  BIGGER  AND  MUCH  HARDER  sHE  WONDERED  IF  fASCINUS  WAS  WITH  THEM  IN  THE  DARKNESS  FOR  SHE  SEEMED  TO  FEEL  THE  BEATING  OF  WINGS  BETWEEN  THEIR  LEGS  AS  SHE  WAS  ENTERED  BY  THE  THING  THAT  GAVE  ORIGIN  TO  LIFE
