Use the ideas presented in the nice_day program in Section 1.8, "Arrays, Strings,
and Pointers," on page 39, to write a program that counts the total number of letters.
Use redirection to test your program. If infile is a file containing text, then
the command
  nletters < infile
should cause something like
  Number of letters: 179
to be printed on the screen.
