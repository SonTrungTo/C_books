# My C references
Top-notch C books.
## Beginner
* [Programming in C (3rd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0672326663/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) - Stephen Kochan. Label: C_Kochan (status: finished)
  * This book is good at nothing but offering the most basic
  tutorials in C. The exercises are fairly straightforward;
  the concepts are simplistically explained, and the many pages
  are filled with typos! I am too lazy to offer such an
  unchallenging book a complete typo list.
* [A book on C](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201183994/?tag=stackoverflow17-20) - - Al Kelley/Ira Pohl (1998). Label: BoC (status: stalled)
  * The level of this book is just baffling: It is neither an advanced C book nor
  an appropriate C beginner book. The problems at the end-of-chapter are incredibly
  frustrating: most of them are either too easy or only verified-purposes; the rest
  are impossible to solve. Reading this book has made me appreciated Kochan's book much
  more. I will stop wasting time with this book!
