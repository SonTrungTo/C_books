# My C references
Top-notch C books.
## Beginner
* [Programming in C (3rd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0672326663/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) - Stephen Kochan. Label: C_Kochan ( status: finished )
  * This book is good at nothing but offering the most basic
  tutorials in C. The exercises are fairly straightforward;
  the concepts are simplistically explained, and the many pages
  are filled with typos! I am too lazy to offer such an
  unchallenging book a complete typo list.
