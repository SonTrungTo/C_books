Hi there. I am Son To, the biggest, most desperated prospective student of Michael Jordan.
I have worked as a senior SWE for 5 years and been living in Finland     for 13 years. I have got my citizenship.
I am saving some money for my journey to     \become Mike's student. The journey will be extremely risky and unsupported by any organizations.
However, I have thought about this endeavour 	very seriously for 13 years. I could 	have started 13 years earlier but could not
because of having to build my own home and assets in Finland.

I am now selling all of my properties to give it all to this 	last journey. I have no regrets if I can start doing it, as long
as I can talk to Mike about my situation and have a chance to persuade him to be my doctoral advisor.
